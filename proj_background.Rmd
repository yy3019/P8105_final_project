## What is it?

The fragility index is a measure of the "fragility" of a clinical trial. It is the equivalent of the required number of people who, if we switch their outcome, would convert the primary endpoint of a significant trial into a non-significant trial. 
<br></br>


## Project's Motivation

The Fragility Index has been suggested to be an easy-to-understand metric of a clinical trialsâ€™ robustness, which may pair well with other frequently discussed metrics like p-values. We are interested how the fragility index may differ based on different clinical trial characteristics. Multiple papers have shown that it requires just a few patients to alter outcomes of many large phase III trials. It is of concern to us that these studies require billions of dollars sunk but outcomes can be "easily" rendered obsolete based on so few participant outcomes. 

Our main question of interest is whether fragility index is associated with a disease type. Specifically, we want to test the difference in fragility index for cancer related therapies to non-oncology immunologic monoclonal antibodies such as allergy, diabetes, and asthma. As a prior belief, we hypothesize that the median fragility Index of trials targeting cancers will be less than trials targeting auto-immune chronic diseases.
