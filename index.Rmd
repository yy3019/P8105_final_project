Fragility index (FI) measures the "fragility" of a clinical trial by iteratively switching the outcomes of patients from the experimental arm to a control and evaluating whether or not the trial becomes non-signifcant. It therefore measures the number of people for this to be true. FI has been suggested to be an easy-to-understand metric of a clinical trialsâ€™ robustness, which may pair well with other frequently discussed metrics like p-values and we are interested in how FI may differ based on different clinical trial characteristics. More details regarding our motivation can be found [here](proj_background.html)

# Dataset

Obtaining our dataset is the hardest portion of this project. After various trial and error, we decided to use [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) as our data source. This is a website provided by U.S. National Library of Medicine that stores information on studies being conducted around the world. Our study is particularly focused on phase III clinical trials that are within the scope of autoimmune disorders. It ***more stuff here
