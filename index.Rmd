# Introduction

Fragility index (FI) measures the "fragility" of a clinical trial by iteratively switching the outcomes of patients from the experimental arm to a control and evaluating whether or not the trial becomes non-signifcant. It therefore measures the number of people for this to be true. FI has been suggested to be an easy-to-understand metric of a clinical trialâ€™s robustness, which may pair well with other frequently discussed metrics like p-values and we are interested in how FI may differ based on different clinical trial characteristics. More details regarding our motivation can be found [here](proj_background.html).

# Dataset

Obtaining our dataset is the hardest portion of this project. After various trial and error, we decided to use [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) as our data source. This is a website provided by U.S. National Library of Medicine that stores information on studies being conducted around the world. 

At first, we set the main target to autoimmune disorders related clinical trials. However, the resulting dataset wasn't big enough for us to conduct further analysis. Therefore, we broadened our criteria to US-based phase III clinical trials. 

This project ended up utilizing two manually created datasets:

1. A dataset created through html scraping clinicaltrials.gov which gave us trials eligible to calculate the fragility index.
2. A separate and distinct dataset created by selecting information by XML to explore geographical and temporal trends in clinical trials from **all available clinical trial data**

# Findings

A quick summary of our findings include:     

1.  Data scraping of clinicaltrials.gov is difficult
2.  Out of 10,000 trials prior to 2017, only 39 met our criteria for calculating the fragility index. 
3.  California has by far the most number of clinical trials out of available data

For detailed results, analysis and output, please refer to our [report](report.html).

# Fun Facts about the project

1. This project utilized 5 custom functions made by members of the team. 
2. The XML for all publicly available clinical trial data is over 800 MB large.
3. To date, there have been 158 clinical trials based in Hawaii, and only 10 in Wyoming.
4. Alabama has the 2nd most industry-backed clinical trials in the US.
